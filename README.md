# Self Hosted Email Guide
We created an open and freely accesible guide to help minimize the pain points of self-hosting email.

#### Why even invest the time?
* âœ… You maintian full control over your most sensitive data
* âœ… You can potentially save hundreds per month if you find the right open source tools and providers
* âœ… If we give up on self-hosting our own email now, what will the future look like?
* âœ… You'll have peace of mind knowing where you most important data is stored
* âœ… Every recipe follows modern development practices

## Questions, Comments, Ideas?
This is a very young project and we'll start organizing things as we go. If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, feel free to open an thread on Github.
